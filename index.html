        <h1> My 1<sup>st</sup> year in college : <em>The Dont's, I've always done</em> </h1>
        <hr>
        <p id="p1">
            Hello everyone, <br>
            Sarthak Khanna this side, I’m a 2nd year CSE student at Chitkara University, in this bog I’m gonna share my experiences (worst & best) with you hoping you’ll find something inspiring or interesting.
            It’s been a year since I joined this course and there are year full of learnings, mistakes, experiences which I wanna share with you guys.
        </p>

            My college stated in September in online mode in which I’ve learned two things: no. 1 – Python Programming Basics, and no. 2 – Connection Building, I’ve learned just basics of python programming in my online classes but I have learned fundamentals of connection building and networking which is trust but not blind trust. This lesson which I started learning on the very first day of my college life, I’ve paid a very high price for this which in emotionally, mentally, and in some ways physically too. 
        </p>
        <p id="3">
            My older sister always taught me that trust is very crucial for any kind of relationship whether with your special someone, your friends or your family. But I guess I’ve missed that lesson and got to learn that lesson by paying a huge amount.
        </p>
        <p id="4">
            I’ve made two friends in the first week of my online classes which somehow proves that I’m not an introvert who sits back and wait for people to interact. I made my first friend indirectly Shubham Singh, he was in my group and called me because he wanna ask something related to our assignment.

            <strong>A quick background check: </strong>
            In my entire schooling life I’ve been an average student in studies but always a curious student. In one of a YouTube lectures I’ve learned it is not about understanding the concepts it is about willing to understand the concepts and willing to learn something new which will eventually come from the presence of mind and conscious learning.
        </p>
        <p id="6">
            So, I applied all the lessons which I’ve learned in my worst school life, which are: never ashamed of asking question, always try to be present in the moment, and become an lifelong learner. I use those crucial life lessons in my online classes and ask questions in my classes for being active during the online lectures, I respond to my course coordinator during our lectures while others are just sitting and listing silently turning off their cams and mics. The result of those learning methods was that Shubham approached me for an assignment problem and we got to know about each other more. Then after few days Shubham introduced me to Shreshtha over an phone call related to assignment discussion and after sometime and few assignments related we all became friends.

            <h3>Learning of connection building: </h3>
            After becoming friends with two complete strangers I learned that for becoming someone’s friend and making deeper connection it is not important that you know them already.

            <h3> 1st Sem </h3>
            My offline college classes started from 26th Nov 2022, and I reached my college on 24th Nov, but eventually my two friends reached college two days earlier than me so they got the same hostel and room and I got another hostel. I thought that I should also shift to their room and stay with them but somehow I changed my mind and stayed in my hostel. I got a 4 seater room in which I was the 2nd person to reach the hostel. I met my two roommates Sagar and Vivek, they’re both great guys and have different kind of personalities. Our college started on Monday and on my very first day I became little bit popular among in my class because I sat on the first bench and in our Web Development lecture I answered all the question our professor asked so I got some sort of topper image continuation which I got to know was not what I’ve thought my fellow classmates thought I was some sort of nerd. It took me my entire 1st sem and half of my 2nd sem to clear that doubt. Over time I made so many friends in my class and hostel but in the end I got down to a group of 8 friends who are from same hostel and floor. We enjoyed being together and rarely make friends in our classes which gave me another piece of learning that connect as much as you can. My 2nd semester ended early because of the 2nd wave of covid hit and we’ve been forced to go back to our homes.

            <h3> 2nd Sem – the mistakes </h3>
            My 2nd sem started in February 2022 and I became someone who rarely interacts with my two friends anymore either because we’re not in the same hostel or maybe I stayed with my roommates and floor-mates more, this may sounds like tomato-tomaato but these are two different scenarios. I choose to be with my group and got to meet some new people and soon did I know on 17th March 2022, I met this beautiful girl which after 2 months is my girlfriend but only for 3 weeks I guess and not continuous. We broke up after 1 week it took me 9 days to get over my emotions and realize that it is not possible that someone will feel about you the same way you feel about them.I became friends with all of them again but not by choice one of my so called friend asked to become normal again and don’t let the group break or don’t be friends with them. I choose to be normal again

        </p>
        <p id="10">
            <h3> Why I did, what I did? </h3>
            I choose to be normal again, I choose to be friends again not because I moved onn or something it’s only because I don’t want my friends to leave me. I became normal with them again and more fun cause this time there are no string attached. But life is not the way you think its gonna be. She approached me with a word, I can’t be just friends with you, so I don’t know why I gave her the 2nd chance but thing have gotten worse this time there is much more insecurity and trust issues so we ended again, this time abruptly. The abrupt ending played a key role in my transformation as a person who I was and what kind of person I am now and trying to become. It took me entire moth to whip off my tears and bounce back on my legs.

            <h3> Rebounding stage – a new chapter </h3>
            After our summer break I came back to college with a determination of clearing all the mess which I have created and focusing on finding calm in chaos. I started clearing the mess by throwing negative people out of my life, cause I believe that your surrounding pays a crucial role in your personality. It was very tough for me to take those hard decisions but this time I choose me over everyone. I prioritize myself over others. It took me 2 months and some lonely time and a lot of introspection to clear all those mess around me. But I got myself back on track and more focused on the things I want and the things I don’t.
        </p>
        <p id="12">
            <h3> Let’s call it off.</h3>
            In this stage of unlearning what the heck and wrong things I’ve learned I’ve developed kind of a hustler mentality and a calm in chaos mindset which was not easy. I’m now more focused on 3 simple rules which are Learn, Un-Learn & Re-Learn, these are the import aspects of learning. But applying these three rules I can see the change, I can see my youtube channel been building up, I can see my podcast episodes launching up. So, if I can see the result I think I’ve followed the right approach.
        </p>

            <h3> The consequences and the learnings</h3>
            I have wasted my entire 1st semester which can never come back, due to which I’ve this feeling of having a backlog of 6 months which I’ve to clear and due to this feeling I tried to learn as much as I can which is good in some way but in some way I’ve missed something which is very important which is depth, due to having a mindset of covering a backlog I became the Jack of “Jack of all trades”, who is still better than one, but I felt like I am master of none. So, I’m relearning what I’ve learned which is not focusing on the depth.
